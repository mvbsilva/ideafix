# IDEAFIX

IDEAFIX present the first approach to identify elephant flows in Internet eXchange Points (IXPs) faster by relying on programmable data planes.
IDEAFIX takes advantage of P4 features to store and analyze the information about the size and duration of the flows entirely in the data plane.
The entire IDEAFIX description and results are presented in the paper: https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2018.8647685.


In a second adaptation, we extended the application of IDEAFIX to use dynamic thresholds. Our mechanism uses the information reported by the data plane to monitor network utilization in the control plane and to calculate local classification threshold values. Thus, the identification thresholds on the switches are updated by the controller to make the identification process more in tune with the network behavior. The entire description and results are compiled in a paper (in progress).
